# Data Modeling and ER Model

Focus on conceptual database design

## Entities and Attributes

* Entity
  * Specific thing or objects in the miniworld that are represented in the database (e.g., EMPLOYEE Mike)
* Attribute
  * Attributes are properties used to describe an entity
* A specific entity will have a value for each of its attributes

### Types of Attributes

* Simple : single atomic (e.g., name)
* Composite : several components (e.g., address)
* Multi-valued

### Entity Types and Key Attributes

* entity type : entities with the same basic attributes are grouped or typed into an entity type
* key attribute : an attribute of an entity type for which each entity must have a unique value
* a key attribute may be composite (e.g., vehicletagnumber : number + state)
* an entity type may have more than one key
* each key is underlined
